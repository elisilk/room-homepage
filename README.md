## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Accessibility
- CUBE CSS
- Sass

### What I learned

Resources I used:

- [Fluid typography and spacing](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/)
- [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) - to convert [Google Font of League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/League+Spartan) into a woff2 compressed form.
- [`cwebp` command-line tool](https://web.dev/articles/serve-images-webp) - to convert JPEG images to the more modern, compressed WebP format.
- [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - The color constrast between the Dark Gray (#A0A0A0 / hsl(0, 0%, 63%)) text color (used in the main text areas) and the white background was not sufficient to pass the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). So I decided to go against the design and change the text color to the lightest gray color that does pass, which is #595959 / hsl(0,
  0%,
  35%).

So many cool ðŸ˜Ž things:

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- Prevent the slider from moving to a new slide when the tab button is pressed from one of the "Shop now" links to the next?
- Hide the horizontal scrollbars on the slider?
  - [Using CSS to hide scrollbars without impacting scrolling](https://blog.logrocket.com/hide-scrollbar-without-impacting-scrolling-css/)

More general ideas I want to consider:

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...
